### ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Preet Kothari

ðŸ’¼ Currently a working professional at ONGC, blessed but not where I aim to be. 

ðŸŽ“ I hold a B.Tech in Petroleum Engineering from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad, India. While my degree qualifies me as a Petroleum Engineer, my true passion lies in the realm of Data Science.

ðŸ’» By day, I tackle challenges in the energy sector, but by night (and any other spare moment), I dive deep into the exciting worlds of Machine Learning/AI, Data Science & Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing.

ðŸš€ I'm on a journey to bridge the gap between my engineering background and my passion for data-driven insights, constantly seeking new opportunities to apply my skills and make a meaningful impact.

ðŸ“± Let's connect and collaborate on innovative projects that push the boundaries of what's possible in data science and beyond!

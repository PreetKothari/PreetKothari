### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Preet Kothari

Currently a working professional at ONGC, blessed but not where I aim to be. 

I have completed my B. Tech in Petroleum Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (ISM) Dhanbad, India. So, I am a Petroleum Engineer by degree but a Data Scientist by passion!

I am interested in the domains of Machine Learning/AI, Data Science & Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing.
